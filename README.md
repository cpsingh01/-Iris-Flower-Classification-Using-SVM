# -Iris-Flower-Classification-Using-SVM
This project uses the Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It includes preprocessing, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), model training, evaluation, and visualization of decision boundaries including hyperplanes with PCA for 2D rendering.
